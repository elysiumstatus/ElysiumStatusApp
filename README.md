# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the project
* [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native)

React native has a great setup guide which should guide you through everything you need to do get started
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

## Installing
After you have react-native running, forked & cloned the repo. Running the development project is simple.
### Android
In your project directory use the [`react-native-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli) to start the project
```
react-native run-android
```
It should spawn a react native packager and the development app should automatically be installed and started on your device or emulator.
